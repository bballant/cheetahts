        <p>Welcome to CheetahTS, The Youth Soccer Sub Planner.</p>
        <p>
            This is an small, open source, web app that anyone can use to plan their soccer team's substitution schedule.
        </p>
        <p>The app was made to work well in a browser and on a phone at game-time. Every change is stored in the URL so all you have to do to save the game is bookmark the (very long) url!</p>
        <p>
            You can create a game and start using the tool with the form below, or click
            <a href="https://github.com/bballant/cheetahts/blob/main/README.md">here</a> to find
            the documentation and the source code.
